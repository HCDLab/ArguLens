"-         render using only those styles (e.g. there is no need to render the `block` class name if no rule in the theme will select it), we can either inline them (i.e. `style=""...""`) or generate tailored class names (with short unique names that will hopefully help the browser do its magic faster).",issue4865_allCommentsText.doc,4865_non-argumentative,18106,18407
"Finally, that will allow us to quickly know what color / boldness / emphasis a certain token has.",issue4865_allCommentsText.doc,4865_non-argumentative,18410,18507
We can then use this information to paint (using a `<canvas>`) rectangles that approximate the text shape.,issue4865_allCommentsText.doc,4865_non-argumentative,18508,18614
The rectangles can be painted only for text that is guaranteed to be Left-To-Right (which is something we now track since a couple of days).,issue4865_allCommentsText.doc,4865_non-argumentative,18615,18755
Bi-Di / RTL text will not get a minimap since our text layout is done by the browser and it would be completely off.,issue4865_allCommentsText.doc,4865_non-argumentative,18756,18872

### Basics,issue4865_allCommentsText.doc,4865_non-argumentative,37332,37342
*         We went with a minimap geometry different than Visual Studio's.,issue4865_allCommentsText.doc,4865_non-argumentative,37345,37418
"*         We ship two grayscale ""fonts"", one where a character is 4x2 (4px high and 2px wide -- abbreviates as `x2`), and another one where a character is 2x1 (2px high and 1px wide -- abbreviated as `x1`).",issue4865_allCommentsText.doc,4865_non-argumentative,37419,37625
"*         Based on the `devicePixelRatio` or on the zoom level, we will pick either the `x2` or the `x1` minimap font.",issue4865_allCommentsText.doc,4865_non-argumentative,37626,37744
"That means on retina devices or on other high pixel ratio devices (e.g. Surface Books) the `x2` font will be picked at `zoomLevel` 0, while on other devices the `x2` font will be picked only when using `zoomLevel` 4 and above.",issue4865_allCommentsText.doc,4865_non-argumentative,37745,37971
"*         This means that a line gets a fixed amount of vertical screen estate in the minimap, either 4px or 2px.",issue4865_allCommentsText.doc,4865_non-argumentative,37972,38085
"*         **If a file has more lines than fit in the minimap, the minimap will scroll**:",issue4865_allCommentsText.doc,4865_non-argumentative,38086,38174

### A note on the fonts,issue4865_allCommentsText.doc,4865_non-argumentative,38307,38330
*         Each character in the minimap is painted according to these `x2` or `x1` fonts,issue4865_allCommentsText.doc,4865_non-argumentative,38333,38421

"The character/tokens rendering code is in a good enough shape (perf wise) to ship it: pixels from the previous frame are copied over to the next frame as they are needed, making a minimap render mostly take below 1ms.",issue4865_allCommentsText.doc,4865_non-argumentative,39036,39253
"Under certain conditions (e.g. minified word-wrapped file, jumping to a different vertical position) it can take up to a few tens of ms, but overall, I'm somewhat happy with the char rendering code.",issue4865_allCommentsText.doc,4865_non-argumentative,39254,39452

"-         The disambiguation of file names by appending the folder name in the tab title in the Editor, IMO, is not necessary unless there are multiple editors open with the same file name.",issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_claim 37, 396_support 37",126790,126979
Note that this scenario is not uncommon even with a single folder open.,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_warrant 37, 396_support 37",126980,127051
It's quite easy to get multiple files (e.g. `.gitignore`) with the same name among subfolders within the same root.,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_warrant 37, 396_support 37",127052,127167
"So this design (appending the parent folder name) should be a separate feature, IMO, and should be implemented.",issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_claim 37, 396_support 37",127168,127279
"Along with this, I'd love to see a good solution to https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15048 because this will make some tab titles even longer. :)",issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,127280,127435
"-         For search results, I think it's essential that search work across all root folders.",issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_claim 22, 396_support 22",127436,127530
Another filter could be added to limit the search to chosen roots.,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_claim 22, 396_support 22",127531,127597
"When displaying results, it might be useful to see results per root, so maybe an option to see one long list with root folder names appended, or to see a list separated in sections, one for each root folder.",issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_warrant 22, 396_support 22",127598,127805
@stevencl thanks for recording the sessions.,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,129712,129756
I really wanted to participate but wasn't available at the time ð¢,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,129757,129825
Thanks for the feedback!,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,131673,131697
"I wanted to follow up on the direction of leveraging a new settings property `additionalFolders` to implement ""Multi Root"" because I hear some feedback on this from the comments above.",issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,131698,131882
The main motivation for introducing a setting in the first place is actually to keep things simple and not introduce too many new concepts while still having a solution that is powerful and enables some interesting scenarios.,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_warrant 44, 396_support 44",131885,132110
Here are some design decisions and consequences:,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_warrant 44, 396_support 44",132111,132159
**Keep it simple**,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_warrant 44, 396_support 44",132162,132180
We feel that opening files and folders is at the core of VS Code.,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_warrant 44, 396_support 44",132181,132246
"Thus we would not want to introduce a new top level concept of ""Projects"".",issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_warrant 44, 396_support 44",132247,132321
"For example, we would not think a ""Open Project"" action was needed, but rather think that a project is always a folder and it can optionally have additional folders associated.",issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_warrant 44, 396_support 44",132322,132498
"With this assumption, a setting seems like the natural way of allowing for that.",issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_warrant 44, 396_support 44",132499,132579
"Whenever you open this folder, you open the additional folders with it.",issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_warrant 44, 396_support 44",132580,132651
Adding and removing folders is a simple gesture and it will update settings directly.,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_warrant 44, 396_support 44",132652,132737
**Settings are powerful**,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_warrant 44, 396_support 44",132740,132765
Having multi root as a setting enables a lot of interesting scenarios.,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_warrant 44, 396_support 44",132766,132836
"For example, you are free to put the `additionalFolders` setting into your workspace and as such share this with other people (by using relative paths - this is shown in the videos).",issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_warrant 44, 396_support 44",132837,133019
"On top of that, you are also free how you setup projects in the first place: for example, in some cases there is no clear relationship of a master folder to additional folders (e.g. it could be that some of them are not even related to each other).",issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_warrant 44, 396_support 44",133020,133268
"In that case you could just create a ""project"" folder that just includes a `settings.json` with the folders it links to: ```allMyRandomProjects/.vscodesettings.json <- contains additionalFolders setting```",issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_warrant 44, 396_support 44",133269,133480
Now when you open `allMyRandomProjects` it will show you the list of folders based on the settings. You can even include some settings in `settings.json` that should apply to all the folders shown.,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_warrant 44, 396_support 44",133483,133680
In my next comment I will provide some feedback on individual comments made.,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,134176,134252
@borekb search would include options to limit to a specific root folder (or multiple) in the same way you can configure search to include a specific path today already.,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_claim 22, 396_support 22",134368,134536
"@maddouri @TurkeyMan @pesho, @dgileadi @stefcameron it seem clear that some people prefer a single tree and other prefer multiple sections in the explorer.",issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_ground 45, 396_support 45",134539,134694
@BTMorton it seems to me you want easier ways to switch workspaces.,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_warrant 32, 396_support 32",135722,135789
This is something we should look into independent from multi-root for any folder transition a user can do.,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,135790,135896
One thing that we have not touched on yet in the videos is how extensions can support multi-root folders.,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,136269,136374
"Another primary goal with multi-root support (besides ""keep it simple"") is: **do not break extensions**",issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,136375,136478
"Today, extensions have simple API to get access to the currently opened workspace (`workspace.rootPath: string`).",issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,136481,136594
This property can be `null` in case no folder is opened.,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,136595,136651
"Now, with the introduction of `additionalFolders` setting, an extension can still rely on the `workspace.rootPath` property being set (if a folder is opened), or not (when no folder is opened).",issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,136654,136847
"Since `additionalFolders` is actually a setting, an extension is free to read and even write to this setting with the APIs we have today around settings already.",issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,136848,137009
"There is even an event emitted when this setting changes, allowing for dynamic reaction to the user changing this setting.",issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,137010,137132
**Reading** this setting allows to make an extension aware of additional folders in the workspace.,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,137135,137233
E.g. the Travis CI extension could chose to show an aggregated status across all folders.,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,137234,137323
"**Writing** this setting enables some interesting scenarios for extensions: e.g. you could have a project-manager extension that dynamically adds and removes folders to your workspace and as such allows for project transitions within the window, e.g. by showing a list of projects via a picker UI.",issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,137326,137623
At one point we will probably introduce some real new extension API to deal with multi-root folders.,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,137626,137726
Burying this inside a setting for extensions to read/write is a bit odd.,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,137727,137799
"But to begin with, extensions can already explore the `additionalFolders` setting to leverage it if possible.",issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,137800,137909
We will also work closely with extension authors to understand their scenarios and how to better support them.,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,137910,138020
"@bpasero Will the concept of additional folders also be added to LSP, or will VS Code simply start one language server per additional folder?",issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,138135,138276
@felixfbecker this is something we still have to invest and explore to find a good solution for language extensions.,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,138386,138502
Once we think about additional APIs for extensions we also need to think about what this means for the LSP.,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,138503,138610
It is worth mentioning though that today you can already have situations where users open a file from a folder that is not opened as workspace (e.g. File > Open > somefile.xyz).,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,138613,138790
Ideally a language extension can show the same level of language features for such a file even if the folder of that file is not opened.,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,138791,138927
@bpasero thanks for the comments.,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,139698,139731
"BTW, how do you define ""root"", exactly?",issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,140224,140263
"Thanks for all the feedback everybody, this is very useful.",issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,142375,142434
@saborrie - good question about the extent to which people would be surprised by the creation of a setting upon adding a folder.,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_claim 47, 396_support 47",142437,142565
We will need to investigate that to see if that is the case (obviously with people who have not been following this thread :-) ).,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_claim 47, 396_against 47",142566,142695
@borekb - we have talked about the scenario you mentioned (opening a folder that contains one or more subfolders) and we have been leaning towards treating this the same as opening a multi root workspace.,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_claim 46, 396_support 46",142698,142902
The challenge though is in determining when to treat such a situation as multi root and not just a folder that contains other folders.,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,142903,143037
I'd be interested in what others think about this too.,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,143040,143094
"@borekb you bring up a good point, I would also say that if you open one folder that contains multiple git repositories within, our SCM view should be able to show you the same view as you would get if you set this up explicitly via the `additionalFolders` property.",issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_claim 46, 396_support 46",143204,143470
I think we can start to explore this UI evolution with folders that have `additionalFolders` setting set and later expand it to more use cases.,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,143471,143614

TypeScript does not use LSP though.,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,141069,141104
"In LSP, language servers have a `rootUri`, and for example PHP will use this `rootUri` to scan for files that need to be indexed.",issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,141105,141234
"It doesn't have a file like tsconfig.json that would denote a ""project"".",issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,141235,141307
"So if there are files that are not opened through `didOpen` but also not under `rootUri`, then these would not get considered for code intelligence, hence my question whether LSP will get extended for this.",issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,141308,141514

Is the intention for VSCode to treat those two situations fairly differently or basically the same?,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,140404,140503
(I think it should be be very similar experience.),issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,140504,140554
"Overall, I think that VSCode should support monorepo vs. multiple repositories in a pretty similar way, as per the comment above: https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/396#issuecomment-306040485.",issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_claim 46, 396_support 46",140021,140221
"So it seems that in the current model, there will **always be a ""master"" folder**: even in the `allMyRandomProjects` example, this is basically the master folder, though mostly empty.",issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,139732,139915
I think it might surprise a user who hasn't been following this thread if they opened a second folder and it created a settings file.,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_claim 47, 396_support 47",142049,142182

Another interesting and related scenario is how we chose to present submodules in a repository.,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,143615,143710
I would also think that eventually we want to support `.vscode` settings on any folder hierarchy level once we have solved the challenges that come with it.,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,143713,143869

"That is correct, if you just open a single file, you cannot go-to-definition to a file in a different file that is not open, but only to those below the `rootUri`.",issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,148109,148272
"That is because in PHP every file can dump symbols in the global namespace, and namespaces are really just name prefixes for classes.",issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,148273,148406
"There is no restriction on how namespaces and class names need to correspond to directories and file names (only some conventions), and there are no import statements like in TS, only namespace aliases.",issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,148407,148609

"Few things, I really dislike the way you append the folder to the end, I'd really like it to be an option because I would probably like to have it like this`express\.editorconfig` and `express-plugin\.editorconfig` so maybe you can offer the following option: `editor.tabName: ""${root}\${filename}""`",issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_warrant 53, 396_support 53",153283,153582

**Flaws of the old solution**,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,187385,187414
The old solution for multi root would introduce a new setting `workspace` (into the global `settings.json`) that allows to add additional folders to a single root folder.,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_ground 25, 396_against 25",187415,187585
"The setting looked like this in case you have not noticed: ```json{""path to folder"": [""additionalFolder1"",""additionalFolder2""]}```",issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_ground 25, 396_against 25",187586,187725
"We call this solution ""master"" folder with additional folders (""detail"").",issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_ground 25, 396_against 25",187728,187801
This was the most straightforward solution without introducing a lot of new concepts but has also flaws:,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_against 25, 396_warrant 25",187804,187908
*         you could never open the master folder as single folder again because the setting persisted,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_against 25, 396_warrant 25",187909,188010
*         you could not remove the master folder from the explorer,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_against 25, 396_warrant 25",188011,188077
*         some settings from the master folder applied to all other folders,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_against 25, 396_warrant 25",188078,188153
*         your settings get polluted with multi-root configuration stuff,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_against 25, 396_warrant 25",188154,188226
"*         it is hard to allow to open a couple of folders at the same time (e.g. when you open 3, which master folder should we take?)",issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_against 25, 396_warrant 25",188227,188361
**Our Solution**,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,188364,188380
We think that a more explicit workspace concept is needed for multi root scenarios and as such in todays insider you will see some new UI popping up:,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_warrant 57, 396_support 57",188381,188530

A couple of changes that were already made today that will hit tomorrows insider release based on feedback:,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,189705,189812
*         rename `.code` to `.code-workspace` as extension for workspaces,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,189813,189886
*         have a unified list of folders and workspaces (e.g. in File > Open Recent) instead of distinguishing between folders and workspaces,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,189887,190028
Stay tuned for more to come ð,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,190031,190063
The idea is that multi-root workspaces require an explicit action to be created.,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,188644,188724
"In the same way that you can be in an empty workspace (no folder opened, purple status bar) or in a single-folder workspace (light-blue status bar) you can also be in a multi-root workspace (dark-blue status bar).",issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,188725,188938
This third way of opening a workspace in VS Code allows to have as many folders as you like. These workspaces can be saved into a file (e.g. `myWorkspace.code`) and also include workspace settings.,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,188939,189136
"You are not forced to save them though, as long as you do not want to save them, they will show up as ""Untitled Workspaces"".",issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,189137,189261
"So in my opinion, you should also take into account that different users might be working on the same folders but with differente settings in `settings.json`.",issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_warrant 69, 396_support 69",190758,190916

"On top of this, we now have one `.vscode` folder per project folder containing the file `settings.json`.",issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_ground 69, 396_support 69",190177,190281
"This file can contain the following: ```// Place your settings in this file to overwrite default and user settings.{""editor.wordWrap"": ""on"",""files.autoSave"": ""onFocusChange"",""editor.fontSize"": 15}```",issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_ground 69, 396_support 69",190282,190490
@DarkLite1 you bring up a good point.,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,191026,191063
In our settings design for multi-root we try to identify settings that we can support per-folder and settings which we cannot support.,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_ground 69, 396_against 69",191064,191198
We typically say that settings which target the editor or a specific resource can be supported per folder because it is clear from which folder the editor was opened. Other settings that will not be supported are more around workbench customization (e.g. showing the statusbar or not).,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_against 69, 396_warrant 69",191199,191484
Your example is about the `editor.fontSize` setting which we actually support per folder even in a multi root workspace.,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_ground 69, 396_against 69",191487,191607
I think it could be a valid scenario that a user wants to have a larger font size for a folder that contains lots of markdown documentation (even a different font maybe?).,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_against 69, 396_warrant 69",191608,191779
So I would think that we should not prevent from respecting this setting per folder also in a multi root environment.,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_against 69, 396_warrant 69",191780,191897
"If you want to keep `editor.fontSize` as a personal workspace setting, then I think it should not get checked into the repository.",issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_against 69, 396_warrant 69",191900,192030
With the new workspaces concept you can do the following:*         File > Workspaces > New Workspace*         Pick your folder*         Open workspace settings*         Change `editor.fontSize: 15`,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_ground 69, 396_against 69",192033,192234
"From then on your workspace will carry this setting, but you are not forcing it to anyone else.",issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_ground 69, 396_against 69",192237,192332
"From UX perspective, it would be convenient if I can drag & drop folders into a VS Code window without explicitly having to create a workspace first",issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_claim 70, 396_support 70",192448,192596
"I invariably work on multiple projects at the same time, and depending on what I'm working on it will be a different (overlapping) set of projects every day.",issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_ground 70, 396_support 70",192644,192801
"Workspaces would introduce a concept that is not native to my way of working, and I'd have to keep track of different workspace configurations (as I understand it) which sounds like it will create some configuration clutter in my project folders.",issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_against 57, 396_warrant 57",192804,193050
"Additionally, I think I speak for many users if I'd argue that things like search, configuration are global by default (apply to all open folders)- though it would be nice if I would have the option to search locally in a folder (I'd always found this tricky in Sublime).",issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_claim 22, 396_support 22",193053,193324

"Currently you cannot drag a folder into the explorer to add it, but this is on our backlog.",issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,194217,194308
The transition from 1 folder to many folders currently is a more explicit step compared to what other editors do (you need to go via File > Workspaces > Save Workspace and pick the folders you want).,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_ground 70, 396_against 70",194461,194660
There is a couple of reasons why we want to go with the current behaviour for now until multi root stabilises.,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_against 70, 396_warrant 70",194661,194771
The main reason is that multi-root is a major change for all our extensions.,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_against 70, 396_warrant 70",194772,194848
The complication with this interaction is that we do not know the intent of the user: to open the folder in the window or to add it to the workspace?,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,194309,194458
"While the explorer works and you can search through all folders, most extensions will not work correctly until the new multi root API is adopted. As such, we do not want to make it too easy in the beginning to enter multi-root by accident.",issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_against 70, 396_warrant 70",194849,195088
It is an explicit user gesture to enter multi root workspaces and in that mode we might want to draw attention to the fact that some extensions are not working yet.,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_against 70, 396_warrant 70",195089,195253
Another reason is workspace settings: Imagine this flow:,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,195256,195312
*         you start with 1 folder which has workspace settings,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_warrant 57, 396_support 57",195313,195375
*         you add a second folder (assume this works without context switch and window reload),issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_warrant 57, 396_support 57",195376,195470
*         you open workspace settings,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_warrant 57, 396_support 57",195471,195508
=> workspace settings in multi root are now stored in some location outside of the folders because you can have multiple,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_warrant 57, 396_support 57",195509,195629
=> we probably need to ask the user if the user wants to migrate the workspace settings to that new location,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_warrant 57, 396_support 57",195630,195738
"So, no matter what, entering multi-root is not a lightweight operation currently.",issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_warrant 57, 396_support 57",195741,195822
"We might revisit this when the dust settles and multi-root is widely adopted, but for now we think this model is better and avoids frustration.",issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_warrant 57, 396_support 57",195823,195966
@DarkLite1 thanks for taking the time to provide feedback on our new strategy for workspaces.,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,198717,198810
Introducing `Workspaces` sounds great as a `feature` but what is the real benefit and what are the disadvantages?,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_against 57, 396_warrant 57",196718,196831
One disadvantage that comes to mind when introducing and using `Workspaces` is that it needs to store it's data (settings) somewhere and it requires user maintenance/awareness.,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_against 57, 396_warrant 57",196834,197010

*         we adopted multi-root APIs and functionality for the extensions that we ship with and that we actively contribute to (e.g. Go),issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,210099,210235
*         extension authors had enough time (e.g. 1 milestone) to adopt the [new multi root APIs](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_15#_new-api-for-multiroot-workspaces),issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,210236,210412

@FelikZ please look at our roadmap (https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/28344).,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,211110,211196
For the September release we plan to adopt the extensions that we ship in VS Code and while we are working on that we add the necessary APIs and utilities needed to do so.,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,211197,211368
During September this is the plan: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/900690/29418707-606f6ae6-836d-11e7-96f3-36d21e7baad8.png),issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,211371,211516
Today's insider update comes with some changes to the `.code-workspace` file that I wanted to summarise here.,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,211628,211737
Existing workspaces with the previous format will automatically be migrated to the new format.,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,211738,211832
"The old format looked like this: ```json{""id"": ""1500007676869"",""folders"": [""file:///Users/bpasero/Development/Microsoft/monaco"",""file:///Users/bpasero/Development/Microsoft/vscode-distro"",""file:///Users/bpasero/Development/Microsoft/vscode-docs"",""file:///Users/bpasero/Development/Microsoft/vscode-extension-sdk""]}```",issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,211835,212164
"And the new format ist: ```json{""folders"": [{ ""path"": ""/Users/bpasero/Development/Microsoft/monaco"" },{ ""path"": ""/Users/bpasero/Development/Microsoft/vscode-distro"" },{ ""path"": ""/Users/bpasero/Development/Microsoft/vscode-docs"" },{ ""path"": ""/Users/bpasero/Development/Microsoft/vscode-extension-sdk"" }]}```",issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,212167,212484
The workspace ID is used to associate a couple of things with the workspace:,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_claim 75, 396_support 75",212504,212580
*         all UI state (e.g. opened files),issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_claim 75, 396_support 75",212581,212623
*         all dirty file state (aka hot-exit),issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,212624,212669
*         extensions state (if any),issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,212670,212705
We decided to remove the `id` property from the workspace file and instead compute the `id` automatically based on the absolute file path of the workspace file on disk.,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_claim 75, 396_support 75",212708,212876
This has a couple of advantages and disadvantages but in the end we think the advantages make this a better solution:,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,212877,212994
*         it was weird that you could edit the `id` in the file simply by typing another value,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_warrant 75, 396_support 75",212995,213089
*         it was not very clear how to treat the `id` when sharing the workspace file with others (should the `id` be changed? should the `id` be a uuid?),issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_warrant 75, 396_support 75",213090,213244
"*         it was not possible to copy a workspace file and open it in a separate window, you had to change the `id` first in the copied file",issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_warrant 75, 396_support 75",213245,213385
"*         as a consequence, the ""Save Workspace As"" action would have to ask the user if the copy should have a different `id` or not",issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_warrant 75, 396_support 75",213386,213519

"In the current single-folder system, when a folder is re-opened from the `File > Open Recent` menu item, the tabs which were open previously are remembered - as far as I can tell this isn't being stored in any user-editable settings file, couldn't the additional paths be stored in the same way, until a user saves them explicitly?",issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,145858,146189

What probably hasn't been said yet with regards to complexity is that you are adding some anyway.,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,168796,168893

There are a couple of things around multi-root workspaces to keep in mind that maybe are not so obvious.,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_warrant 57, 396_support 57",199470,199574
I hope the following detailed explanation helps to understand our design process:,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_warrant 57, 396_support 57",199575,199656
**Workspace Settings**,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,199659,199681
We do support having settings inside a workspace folder (`.vscode` folder).,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_warrant 57, 396_support 57",199682,199758
"As much as some users might not like these kind of settings that end up in `.gitignore` files or the repository, there are many that rely on this functionality.",issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_warrant 57, 396_support 57",199758,199918
"We cannot simply stop supporting settings that live within folders because users rely on them. Now, for multi-root scenarios it is clear that we have to find a new place for workspace settings.",issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_warrant 57, 396_support 57",199919,200112
We came up with the concept of a workspace file that contains these settings.,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_warrant 57, 396_support 57",200113,200190
"As long as the workspace is not saved anywhere, it resides in a folder that has other VS Code specific data contained and when you save the file, the settings will be within that file.",issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_warrant 57, 396_support 57",200191,200375
Ask the user to migrate the settings?,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_against 72, 396_warrant 57, 396_warrant 72, 396_support 57",200572,200609
We decided to make this an explicit context switch to make it clear that opening a workspace carries its own workspace settings in a different location.,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_against 72, 396_warrant 57, 396_warrant 72, 396_support 57",200610,200762
And now imagine you went from 1 folder to 2 folders and we moved workspace settings to some other place.,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_against 72, 396_warrant 57, 396_warrant 72, 396_support 57",200765,200869
Imagine you make changes to these workspace settings.,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_against 72, 396_warrant 57, 396_warrant 72, 396_support 57",200870,200923
"Now you want to go back from 2 folders to 1, would you expect to migrate the workspace settings back into the folder?",issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_against 72, 396_warrant 57, 396_warrant 72, 396_support 57",200924,201041
Another example: You transition from 1 to 2 folders and configure workspace settings.,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_against 72, 396_warrant 57, 396_warrant 72, 396_support 57",201044,201129
Now you close the window.,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_against 72, 396_warrant 57, 396_warrant 72, 396_support 57",201130,201155
I think you would get mad at us if you could not get back to this workspace in some way because you carefully configured settings for this workspace.,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_against 72, 396_warrant 57, 396_warrant 72, 396_support 57",201156,201305
"So even though you do not like the concept of a workspace, once you configure settings for it I think you want that workspace to live on.",issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_against 72, 396_warrant 57, 396_warrant 72, 396_support 57",201306,201443
**Extensions**,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,201563,201577
All of our extensions always worked against an API that provides a single workspace path because up until now we did not support multi-root workspaces.,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_warrant 57, 396_support 57",201578,201729
As a user you might think that switching from 1 folder to 2 folders is a very simply and lightweight operation but for extensions it can mean a lot of things: Language extensions that so far assumed there is just one folder suddenly have to be aware of multiple folders.,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_warrant 57, 396_support 57",201730,202000
"And on top of that, these folders can come and go very dynamically at any time.",issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_warrant 57, 396_support 57",202001,202080
Introducing a real workspace concept gives us some more room and time to breadth and help extensions adopt this concept.,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_warrant 57, 396_support 57",202083,202203
We could for example disable extensions that have not yet adopted multi-root workspaces to prevent weird things from happening (e.g. a language extension only works on the one folder and reports wrong errors on the other).,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_warrant 57, 396_support 57",202204,202426
Let's try to stabilise on multi-root support with these new workspaces first and then revisit how lightweight we can make the transitions.,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,202429,202567
"Once we have extensions on-board and figured out our settings story, I think we can make the flip to a more lightweight experience.",issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,202568,202699
"PS: since you make a reference to other editors with regards to their multi-root support, I just wanted to point out that these editors also come with a workspace or project concept that you can save to a file and share with others.",issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_ground 57, 396_support 57",202702,202934
Typically you are not seeing these concepts because going from 1 to N folders is a very lightweight operation.,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_warrant 57, 396_support 57",202935,203045
I would argue though that people that rely on this feature start to move to saved workspaces/projects as a way to manage work.,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_warrant 57, 396_support 57",203046,203172
"For example, unless you save workspace/project and close the window, all this information is lost.",issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_warrant 57, 396_support 57",203173,203271
As I'm not fully acquainted with [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/projects.html) I took the liberty to check on how they handles this.,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_ground 57, 396_support 57",203487,203633
"And you are correct, they use `Workspaces` too and even `Project` files.",issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_ground 57, 396_support 57",203634,203706
"But as you mentioned, if others rely on this, it has to be taken into account that this might just be what is best.",issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_warrant 57, 396_support 57",203798,203913
The only thing that bothers me a bit is that it puts VS Code files in between my project.,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_warrant 38, 396_support 38",203708,203797
I'm only wondering why these setting files are not user specific?,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_claim 38, 396_support 38",203914,203979
"I can imagine a colleague opening up VS Code on the same folder structure, but wanting to have his own settings.",issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_warrant 38, 396_support 38",203980,204092
"If `Workspaces` are the way forward, and it seems they are, it would be logical upon opening the app that it will reload the last used settings.",issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_warrant 38, 396_support 38",204095,204239
Even if this is an unsaved `Workspace`.,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_warrant 38, 396_support 38",204240,204279
It makes life a bit simpler I guess.,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_warrant 38, 396_support 38",204280,204316
One approach could be to conceptually treat any set of projects with the same configuration as a workspace.,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_claim 73, 396_support 73",205237,205344
"In addition to that, you could refrain from adding a `.vscode` folder as long as the project does not diverge from the default config.",issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_claim 73, 396_support 73",205345,205479
That should:1)         get rid of most clutter in projects,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_warrant 73, 396_support 73",205480,205539
"2)         prevent most config clashes when adding projects (in the simple case, there will be no config)",issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_warrant 73, 396_support 73",205540,205645
I think the explicit workspace concept as discussed is a good solution to the mentioned problem.,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_claim 57, 396_support 57",205648,205744
With these two simple rules I minimize the usecases where people run into this problem.,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_warrant 57, 396_warrant 73, 396_support 73, 396_support 57",205745,205832

It shouldn't force to _create a workspace_ just to add another folder to the current window.,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_claim 74, 396_support 74",206129,206221
"It should just add the new folder in the tree, and leave the newly created workspace as an _internal info_.",issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_claim 74, 396_support 74",206222,206329
"If the user decides to save the workspace, then the workspace is really created.",issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_claim 74, 396_support 74",206330,206410
"And even if I don't save the workspace, while reopening the top-folder, it would _remember_ my temporary workspace_ and open the other folders as well, just like it remembers the opened files when you open a folder today.",issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_claim 74, 396_support 74",206411,206633
"BTW, I wonder how I could open multi-folder in command-line.",issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,206633,206693

Those serve the purpose of informing the VSCode team about your interest but prevent meaningless `+1` comments.,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,396_non-argumentative,12096,12207

and closing a tab is a bit more intuitive than having 10+ working files.,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,"224_against 6, 224_warrant 1, 224_warrant 6, 224_support 1",24014,24086

A simple example would be `.cpp` and '.h' with tabs it would be two clicks both focused on top of the window whereas with working files it would be 3-4 clicks with working files which require you to select the editor in question and then select the new file to edit.,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,"224_ground 1, 224_ground 6, 224_against 6, 224_support 1",24608,24874
Tabs and custom tabs would also allow for some interesting extensions to be added easier.,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,"224_warrant 1, 224_support 1",24877,24966
An example is a console or a plot tab.,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,"224_warrant 1, 224_support 1",24967,25005
These would either require special entries in the file selector section or would have to be discarded on close with the current system.,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,"224_warrant 1, 224_support 1",25006,25141
I very regularly come back to my plots so closing the window would then require it to be re-plotted.,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,"224_warrant 1, 224_support 1",25142,25242
Or the console would be closed and the data inside lost.,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,"224_warrant 1, 224_support 1",25243,25299

One of the ways we try to achieve this is through being very careful about any new UI we add to the product.,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,27402,27510

There are couple situations where a tab bar is **absolutely** demanded.,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,"224_warrant 1, 224_support 1",59704,59775
1.         Quickly switch between many tabs.,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,"224_warrant 1, 224_support 1",59776,59820

A diff won't solve the problem because they are different characters.,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,"224_warrant 1, 224_support 1",59975,60044

I assume someone will have some stuff to share in writing afterwards? :D,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,200320,200392
Brief overview:,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,200503,200518
"1.         Tabs and working files (renamed ""open editors"") behave exactly the same way, it just depends whether you want the visuals on top (tabs) or to the left (open editors)",issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,200519,200695
"2.         Tabs are grouped by panel visually at the top, open editors are grouped together under headers ""Left"", ""Right""",issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,200696,200817
"3.         Single click a file to open a preview tab (or ""open editor""); double-click the file, edit the file, or double-click the tab itself to persist",issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,200818,200970
4.         Debugger opens all files as preview files unless you persist the file being debugged by taking one of the above options,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,200971,201101
5.         Tabs/open editors can be dragged between panels,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,201102,201160
6.         Panels can be dragged to move the whole group of tabs,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,201161,201225
"Looks really good, and personally (from the very pro-tab group if you read my post above), I think I will be happy to give the new ""Open Editors"" a fair shot.",issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,201228,201386
I was only able to join for the last 15 minutes or so.,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,202613,202667
Was it recorded?,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,202668,202684
Sounds like there were some good ideas.,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,203407,203446
I look forward to seeing this in action.,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,203447,203487
FWIW (and if it's still relevant) I still think it's better not to have tabs in the UI _by default_.,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,"224_claim 31, 224_support 31",203490,203590
I was disappointed (but not surprised) to see that tabs are likely tobecome the default.,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,"224_warrant 31, 224_support 31",202687,202776
A hope you will continue to preserve the lightweightenvironment of VS Code and to explore progressive workflows.,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,"224_warrant 31, 224_support 31",202777,202890
Thanks for everyone who was able to attend and give us feedback today.,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,203857,203927
We've taken notes and have been continuously following the GitHub issue here.,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,203929,204006
We're listening to everyone.,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,204008,204036
"@indiejames and @RyanEwen yes we took notes, and we will be posting soon.",issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,204039,204112
"Thanks to everyone who took the time to join the call today and provide feedback, we really appreciate it.",issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,204807,204913
@anyong has done a great job already summarising what we presented but I will add a few more details below and some screenshots.,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,204914,205042
"### Visual design First, this image indicates how we think tabs might look in VS Code:![image2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1704059/14716846/b384acc2-07e6-11e6-98c9-7a450ff2f4c3.png)",issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,205045,205245
"We are aiming for a lightweight, non distracting look, something that fits in well with the rest of VS Code.",issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,205248,205356
We haven't yet drawn up what it would look like in a light theme.,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,205357,205422
"As you can see in the above image, tabs contain a close button to the left of the name. When the file contains unsaved changes we show a dirty indicator where the close button is.",issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,205425,205604
Hovering over a tab will show a tooltip with the full path for the file in the tab.,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,205607,205690
### Preview tabs To clearly distinguish preview tabs from open tabs we italicize the title in the tab as in the following wireframe.,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,205693,205827
![image1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1704059/14716802/83765b0c-07e6-11e6-9c24-e1e611b9f327.png),issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,205828,205939
We discussed actions for promoting a preview tab to a full open tab:,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,205942,206010
-         Editing content inside the tab,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,206011,206051
-         Double clicking a file in the explorer,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,206052,206100
-         Double clicking the preview tab in the tab group,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,206101,206159
### Overflow,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,206162,206174
Tabs open to the right of the active tab.,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,206177,206218
If there is not enough room to show all of the tabs in a tab group we overflow the tabs.,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,206219,206307
We do not truncate the name of the file inside the tab to make more room for more tabs.,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,206308,206395
We show a chevron whenever there is an overflow.,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,206398,206446
"Clicking on that chevron will show a quick open dialog that lists all of the tabs in the tab group, allowing the user to find the tab they want to view.",issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,206447,206599
Clicking a tab that is currently in overflow will bring that tab into view.,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,206602,206677
### Navigating tabs,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,206680,206699
The following commands allow users to navigate amongst tabs:,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,206702,206762
-         Ctrl-Tab shows a list of all tabs inside the active tab group:![image3](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1704059/14717339/e70a02ca-07e8-11e6-95c4-125b6da3c87a.png),issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,206763,206947
-         Ctrl Alt Tab shows a list of all tabs inside all tab groups![image4](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1704059/14717356/0c0f134e-07e9-11e6-8d55-fddf7689de10.png),issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,206948,207129
-         Quick open shows the linear history of all tabs![image5](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1704059/14717401/3c43f1ba-07e9-11e6-856a-32260e01cfcf.png),issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,207130,207299
### Working files,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,207302,207319
We renamed working files to open editors to better reflect what this really is.,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,207322,207401
The list of open editors works identically to tabs. We just list them in the explorer rather than visualising them as tabs.,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,207404,207527
If a file is open in two or more editor groups we show this in the open editors list:![image6](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1704059/14717499/bd28dc8c-07e9-11e6-9d0d-32b4b4b65ec4.png),issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,207530,207727
Any editor that the user opens shows up in the open editors list.,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,207730,207795
"So for example, the diff editor shows up like so:![image7](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1704059/14717539/f1386f4c-07e9-11e6-896f-ef76e4f0e559.png)",issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,207796,207957
Each group only contains one preview tab.,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,207960,208001
The chevron at the top right of the active editor group indicates whether or not there is a stack of editors.,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,208004,208113
![image8](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1704059/14717662/62bbb5d4-07ea-11e6-876c-1901a72e1441.png),issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,208114,208225
"In this case, closing an editor will reveal the editor below it in the stack, rather than closing the editor completely.",issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,208228,208348
Closing an editor (for example with Ctrl-W) also removes the editor from the list of open editors.,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,208351,208449
"As I wrote before I'd also want to know whether there's an option to have no tabs or open editors at all, this can be useful scenario for people that do scripting e.g. PowerShell.",issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,208819,208998
@eyalsk it was mentioned in the discussion that tabs and open editors should be independently enabled or disabled for either/both/none.,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,209109,209244
@anyong thanks! :),issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,209355,209373
"Finally! Tabs or not, this is the behaviour I've been waiting for!",issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,209552,209618
No more getting lost in my file history.,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,209619,209659
Great!,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,209765,209771
Now I'll just wait for https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5554 to close.,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,209864,209944
This will hopefully feel more intuitive and help clean up the clutter in _Working files_.,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,209772,209861
"Hmm I don't know whether this was considered but I thought about it just now, multiple monitors suppot!",issue224_allCommentsText.doc,"224_warrant 2, 224_support 2",210055,210158
"I'd imagine it's possible to achieve this by creating a new VSCode process and drag tabs between processes through inter-process communication, the same goes for open editors, just an idea, :)",issue224_allCommentsText.doc,"224_warrant 2, 224_support 2",210291,210483
"Please, please, please can you make ""preview tabs"" optional - i.e. have an option to make anything auto-promote to a permanent tab and never have stuff disappearing.",issue224_allCommentsText.doc,"224_claim 33, 224_support 33",210605,210770
"I know you're discussing ways to visually distinguish tabs that are temporary but, frankly, that won't work for people like me who navigate between files so quickly (particularly with Go-To-Definition et al.) that there's no time to visually inspect the tab to divine how it might behave,",issue224_allCommentsText.doc,"224_warrant 33, 224_support 33",210771,211059
I typically bury myself in open tabs until I have finished a unit of work and then close them all at the same time that I go to commit.,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,"224_ground 33, 224_support 33",211261,211396
"Thanks @eyalsk, yes we did consider it.",issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,211509,211548
Ultimately we would like to be able to support this but the work required to share context between multiple processes is quite significant and so it is unlikely to happen while we work on the rest of the document management UX.,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,211549,211776
It's definitely something we want to do though.,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,211777,211824
@stevencl I'd be happy if dragging just opened a new vscode window with that file open (maybe with the same folder open too).,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,"224_claim 2, 224_support 2",211935,212060
"Thanks @Tyriar, we will keep looking into this.",issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,212173,212220
"If there is a way we can make it work well, we'd love to be able to do it.",issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,212221,212295
@stevencl I'm just worried that it will require even more work to add it in the future so _when_ you improve the infrastructure make sure to keep it in your backlogs! ;),issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,212406,212575
Great to see this.,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,212812,212830
Love the lightweight proposal and that you are finding a way to not break the working files experience.,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,"224_warrant 5, 224_support 5",212831,212934
tabs please,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,"224_claim 1, 224_support 1",212686,212697
Looking forward to giving it a spin.,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,212937,212973
Thanks for listening.,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,212974,212995
@stevencl That seems like the best of both worlds.,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,213108,213158
Looks wonderful!,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,213159,213175
"The tabs appear as I would have expected them to in order to fit in with the rest of the UI, and it sounds like I'd be getting exactly what I want with the Working Files changes :)",issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,213176,213356
Will Open Editors support more than 2 editor groups?,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,213359,213411
Just wondering how you name them if it's more complicated than Left and Right.,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,213412,213490
"Yes, this would still be supported.",issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,213603,213638
@stevencl I think what you outlined from the discussion a few days ago is great.,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,214335,214415
This is exactly what we all have been waiting for regarding tabs.,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,214416,214481
"@jayrosen1576 horizontal splitting is captured in this issue https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/1749, be sure to :+1: to show your interest.",issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,215435,215583
A few of the other editors I have use also implement horizontal as well as vertical panel configurations.,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,"224_ground 34, 224_support 34",214482,214587
This allows you to have two files opened side by side at the top and one or two opened below them.,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,"224_warrant 34, 224_support 34",214588,214686
"While this is a not a critical feature, I do find myself missing this quite often while developing front end web apps & mobile apps.",issue224_allCommentsText.doc,"224_warrant 34, 224_support 34",214687,214819
"The reason is most of what I work on is MVC or derivations thereof so having a model, view, controller and some UI file (css, Js, etc) open at the same time is a huge benefit.",issue224_allCommentsText.doc,"224_warrant 34, 224_support 34",214820,214995
Are there plans to include this as well?,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,"224_claim 34, 224_support 34",214996,215036
Atom does this really well which was the last editor I used before VSCode.,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,"224_warrant 34, 224_support 34",215037,215111
"Unfortunately it severely lacked in other areas that VSCode excels at, hence my sole use of VSCode.",issue224_allCommentsText.doc,"224_warrant 34, 224_support 34",215112,215211
"If not in the planned release with tabs & document management changes, this would be a great future enhancement.",issue224_allCommentsText.doc,"224_warrant 34, 224_support 34",215212,215324
Good work guys the wire frames look like they would work really well.,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,215698,215767
Thanks for the great work and here is my 2 cents about the close button to the left.,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,215890,215974
"When there are many files open and the tabs are getting shrinked, the small space for each tab will only be enough to show the close button which will make it easier to accidentally close the tab instead of selecting it.",issue224_allCommentsText.doc,"224_warrant 35, 224_support 35",215975,216195
@stevencl Mock-ups look great and description of functionality sounds spot-on.,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,216521,216599
"I'm sure you've experimented with this calibration however, so I look forward to trying it out!",issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,216872,216967
"@hsyn it was my understanding that the tabs will not shrink, and overflow tabs will be available from the chevron overflow button.",issue224_allCommentsText.doc,"224_against 35, 224_warrant 35",217078,217208
The close button shouldnt be an issue.,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,"224_claim 35, 224_against 35",217209,217247
I don't agree with that.,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,217589,217613
"If the screen is split into 2-3 columns, you will then be showing 1-2 tabs at most and overflowing the rest.",issue224_allCommentsText.doc,"224_against 37, 224_warrant 37",217614,217722
we use them every day and it's intuitive and we are used to it.,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,"224_against 37, 224_warrant 37",217759,217822
"I encourage you to use established patterns, some of them have been evolving for over a decade now.",issue224_allCommentsText.doc,"224_against 37, 224_warrant 37",217823,217922
Don't go against the grain.,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,"224_against 37, 224_warrant 37",217923,217950
Some browsers do a combination of shrinking tabs but then overflowing them beyond a certain threshold.,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,"224_ground 37, 224_support 37",218432,218534
Firefox does it; pretty sure iOS Safari does (or did) it too.,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,"224_ground 37, 224_support 37",218536,218597
"When enough tabs are open that you can barely see a few letters in each one (though in practice I normally don't have that many open), it's not particularly more usable than overflow would be.",issue224_allCommentsText.doc,"224_warrant 37, 224_support 37",218600,218792
"@alexgorbatchev I definitely get where you're coming from, but this was something they explained in the conference call the other day - from the other perspective, having a ton of opened tabs and not being able to read the names of any of them is not a good solution either.",issue224_allCommentsText.doc,"224_warrant 37, 224_support 37",218903,219177
"The ""overflow"" is sort of a compromise between no tabs at all and standard ""Chrome style"" tabs that shrink into oblivion.",issue224_allCommentsText.doc,"224_warrant 37, 224_support 37",219178,219299
Forcing the tabs to at least display the filenames means that the visible tabs will at least be useful.,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,"224_warrant 37, 224_support 37",219300,219403
"But you did give me an idea though for the devs - I think the real issue here is that, while we know we cant use 20 tabs when all the filenames are hidden, at least we _know_ that there are 20 tabs open and it provides us a certain feeling of ""I know where my files are if I need them, they didn't just disappear.""",issue224_allCommentsText.doc,"224_warrant 38, 224_support 38",219406,219720
"All it would take to fix that is an indicator showing the _number_ of currently hidden tabs, the indicator could just be a little circle above the overflow chevron so as not to take up any extra horizontal space.",issue224_allCommentsText.doc,"224_claim 38, 224_support 38",219721,219933
Thanks everyone.,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,220046,220062
"We didn't show it in the mockups but our intention is that when required,",issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,220063,220136
"For the reasons @anyong mentions, we don't think we want to shrink to the point where filenames aren't distinguishable from one another.",issue224_allCommentsText.doc,"224_warrant 39, 224_support 39",220229,220365

4.

"Why is `ctrl+tab` so much more useful than the 'working files' concept, as it stands?",issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,158941,159026
This is the crux question.,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,159027,159053
"Personally, I think there are two issues at play.",issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,159054,159103
"Firstly, `ctrl+tab` is a keyboard shortcut and keyboard shortcuts are subconsciously associated with the caret - the user expects that `ctrl+tab` will change the file in the current editor, where the caret currently is placed, and that's precisely what it does.",issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,159106,159368
This is unlike 'working files' or the navigator which aren't associated with a particular editor - they're horizontally distanced from all but one editor and associated with the _most recent_ editor - and are typically used with the mouse.,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,159368,159607
"Even if you use them with the keyboard, you've departed from your caret by the time you select a file.",issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,159608,159710
"Secondly, `ctrl+tab` shows you _all_ the files you've seen, recently, in reverse chronological order.",issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,159713,159814
'Working files' shows you only the ones you either double-clicked or made changes to and in the order that you bothered to open them.,issue224_allCommentsText.doc,224_non-argumentative,159815,159948

"We can increase horizontal real estate for code and maintain tab access.
