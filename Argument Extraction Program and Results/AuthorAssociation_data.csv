Whilst editing the mod files it's common to *only* work in the mod level of the game (instead of what we call the core or native level of the actual game code. e.g. Working only in the Lua files instead of C++ and C# files for server and client respectively).,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_ground 1, 396_support 1",63169,63428,2017-01-12T00:51:09Z,truthmeister6,2017-01-12T08:52:37Z,CWolfs,2017-01-15T21:19:43Z,nowherenearithaca,NONE

In our settings design for multi-root we try to identify settings that we can support per-folder and settings which we cannot support.,issue396_allCommentsText.doc,"396_ground 69, 396_against 69",191064,191198,2017-07-13T13:47:02Z,DarkLite1,2017-07-13T14:02:20Z,bpasero,2017-07-13T20:57:57Z,SanderMertens,MEMBER
We typically say that settings which target the editor or a specific resource can be supported per folder because it is clear from which folder the editor was opened.
